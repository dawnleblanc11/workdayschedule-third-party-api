This application is designed for employees with a busy schedule.  It allows them to add important events to a daily planner and manage time effectively.  They can also keep track of where they are in their day with color coding.

**features**

 * Moment.js library to work with date and time
 * Uses Bootstrap for formatting of calendar
 * External Fonts
 * Uses JQuery to access calendar elements and make updates
 * Basic JAVAscript uses of functions, arrays and loops
 * Runs in the browser
 * Scroll down calendar to see all time slots
 * Time blocks for standard business hours 8 am to 6 pm (use of military time in javascript)
 * Save button to save revised tasks
 * Storage of revised tasks so when returning to schedule or refresed the screen they are populated
 * Complete READme file
 

**future features**
 * Ability to store more than one day
 * Additional edits so user is locked out when time has past
 * Prompt if text entered into area and user forgets to hit enter
 * Update to an alternative date function since Moment.js is considered legacy
